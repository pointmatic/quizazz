- question: "What is the time complexity of binary search?"
  answers:
    correct:
      - text: "O(log n)"
        explanation: "Binary search halves the search space with each comparison, yielding logarithmic time complexity."
    partially_correct:
      - text: "O(n)"
        explanation: "O(n) is the complexity of linear search, not binary search. Binary search is faster."
    incorrect:
      - text: "O(n²)"
        explanation: "O(n²) is typical of naive sorting algorithms, not search algorithms."
      - text: "O(1)"
        explanation: "O(1) would mean constant time regardless of input size, which is not how binary search works."
    ridiculous:
      - text: "O(n!)"
        explanation: "Factorial time complexity would make binary search slower than almost any known algorithm."

- question: "Which element has the chemical symbol 'O'?"
