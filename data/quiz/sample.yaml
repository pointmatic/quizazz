    tags: ["technology", "math"]
    answers:
      correct:
        - text: "O(log n)"

      partially_correct:
        - text: "O(n)"
          explanation: "O(n) is the complexity of linear search, not binary search. Binary search is faster."

          explanation: "O(n²) is typical of naive sorting algorithms, not search algorithms."
        - text: "O(1)"

      partially_correct:
        - text: "Deque"
